# ESP PCB
A simple PCB on which a ESP32 Devkit V4 can be mounted. All parts are selected so that it can be completely printed and assembled by popular PCB manufacturers
whith a SMT assembly service. 

The original idea was for it to be used to control LED strips but any project that needs MOSFETs or a shield on which to connect sensors will benefit from this board.
